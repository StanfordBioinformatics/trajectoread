The pipeline encompasses everything involved in translating a biological sample into a processed digital representation of genetic information. Workflows are DNAnexus objects listing a series of DNAnexus applets, along with their configuration parameters, to be run sequentially. From the DNAnexus wiki:

"Workflows are objects which list a series of executables (apps or applets) and configuration parameters specifying how to run them. For example, a DNA sequencing workflow may consist of a series of 3 apps: mapping, variant calling, and variant annotation. The outputs of one executable can be configured to be inputs to the next. Each executable listed in a workflow, together with its configuration and I/O parameters, is called a stage. At the moment, workflows are not allowed to be used as executables for a stage.

An analysis is the execution of a workflow, similarly to how a job is the execution of an app. Both jobs and analyses can also be referred to as the runs of their respective executables (workflows, apps, or applets)."

When BCL data for a sequencing run is generated by an Illumina sequencer, it is automatically transferred to our local NetApp data repository. An autocopy script will periodically check for new runs. If it finds a new run, it will generate a data tarball for each lane of the run as well as a tarball including metadata common to all lanes. It will then create a DNAnexus project corresponding to that lane as well a DNAnexus Dashboard record for the project. The Dashboard record will include pertinent metadata about the sequencing run lane. The autocopy script will then call the 'initiate_workflow' applet which will choose the appropriate workflow, populate the project record with additional metadata properties obtained from the LIMS, and then start the analysis.

Dashboard record metadata {
	sequencing run name,
	lane index,
	name of the sequencing platform,
	sequencing platform model,
	submitter/client name,
	recipient email address(es),
	mapper,
	[other optional workflow options]
}
